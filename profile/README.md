# Purpose

>Science is often regarded as a body of knowledge that enables us to predict and explain phenomena in our natural world. Another aspect - the process of pursuing such knowledge, was less emphasized, though important. The process of scientific research is a collaborative effort which involves asking questions and formulating hypothesis, identifying information, designing and carrying out investigations, analysing data and communicating findings. This module provides an opportunity for students to be inquirers by conducting in depth study in the area of their interest. Through the process, students acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes that will be useful to them not only when they continue to do science beyond the secondary level, but throughout their lives.

## The aims of ISS are as follows:
### What is Science?
- Show an understanding that scientific models may take many forms and are able to provide explanations and predictions of how the natural world is structured or how it operates

- Recognise that scientific explanations rely on evidence, have logically consistent arguments, and use scientific models, and theories

- Show an awareness that although major science ideas are well tested over time and are unlikely to change, scientists have changed their ideas about nature occasionally when new experimental evidence cannot be explained using the prevailing theories

- Show an awareness that science is a collaborative enterprise and open communication and scientific argumentation are part of the scientific inquiry process

- Show an understanding that science is a process which involves asking questions and pursuing solutions to questions 
### Generating Research Questions and Formulating Hypothesis
- Identify questions that can be answered through scientific investigations

- Recognise that a scientific hypothesis is a tentative explanation or educated guess that can be tested to prove that it is wrong

- Formulate testable hypothesis from research questions
### Literature Review
- Search for science and research articles in the related fields of interest 

- Evaluate and build upon prior research done in the related fields
### Experimental Design
- Identifies key variables to carry out an investigation 

- Show an awareness that in an investigation of the relationship between two chosen variables, it is important to identify and control the other variables and factors that may affect the results of the investigation

- Show an awareness that observations or measurements will always have some uncertainty and there is a need to repeat experiments to improve the reliability of the results

- Design a fair experiment which avoid investigator bias
### Writing a Research Proposal
- Communicate steps of scientific investigations effectively through writing a research proposal prior to experimentation 
### Data Analysis & Drawing Conclusion (Results, Discussion & Conclusions) 
- Collect relevant and accurate data 

- Record data in an appropriate manner 

- Process relevant data for meaningful interpretation of experimental results

- Draw conclusion that are consistent with observations 

- Accept or reject hypothesis based on experimental results

- Suggest future extension of research project

- Suggest possible application of research work 
### Research Project Presentation
- Communicate research findings through written papers and oral presentations
